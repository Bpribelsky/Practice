# Lesson 1 - Using a github repository

## Theory

Github is a service that provides its users with a version control system.   

Git is the version control system that is used by the web service at github.

A version control system is used to track every version of every file so that no code is ever lost.

A repository contains all of the different versions of the files.

The first benefit of version control is being able to browse through the version history of all of the files.

Later we will expand this to allow multiple users to work together.
