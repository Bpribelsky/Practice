# Lesson 3 - Clone a Repository

UNC Version Control Skills


## Theory

### Git Clone

Without logging in to Github you are considered an anonymous user, which allows you to see public repositories from
any user.

You are not allowed to make any changes until you have logged in with a user ID that has the correct permissions.

You can make a copy of another user's repo as your own and then make changes to your own repo.

Once you have cloned the repo you are free to make changes to your own version.

These changes will not affect the original.


## Practice

### Login To Github.com

In the last lesson you registered for a Github user account.  Now you are ready to make changes to your repos.
