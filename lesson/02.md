A repository contains all of the different versions of the files.


### Viewing Files

Github displays all of the files in your repository.  You can browse the files and see the contents of each file.

You can also browse through the version history of all of the files in the repo.

You can not modify any content until you have the correct permissions.


### Sign In to Modify Files

In order to modify files you must be logged into Github.

Once you are logged in you will be able to modify the contents of any repo that you have permissions for.

If you have the correct permissions you will see an edit button on each file in the file browser view.
