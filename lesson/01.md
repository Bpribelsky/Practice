# Lesson 1 - Using a Github Repository

UNC Version Control Skills


## Theory

A version control system is used to track every version of every file so that no code is ever lost.

Github is a service that provides its users with a version control system.   

Git is the version control system that is used by the web service at github.

A repository contains all of the different versions of the files.

The file browser shows you the files that are in the working set of files. These files are currently active in your project.
