# UNC Github Project

## Project Objectives

Version Control is an essential development skill for anyone that deals with computer files.  
This includes all of the business students as well as CIS and Engineers.

While every student should understand a little about version control, must students do not
need a deep understanding.  Only the most technically inclined students will need to understand
advanced topics like Pull Requests, merging, and branching.


## Organized as a Gradual Learning

The full list of topics has been organized so that the most basic usage is taught first.  
A teacher may choose to teach either 1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 lessons depending on the skills needed.

Lesson 1 covers using code from a repo.  Any student can complete this lesson in about 10 minutes
and gain a basic skill that would be useful throughout the class.

There are multiple skill levels that teachers may choose.

* Level 1 - Read only code
* Level 2 - Code lives on Github
* Level 3 - Github Desktop (Windows/Mac app)
* Level 4 - Command Line Basics
* Level 5 - Merge & Branch
* Level 6 - Pull Requests


## Lessons are self-contained

Each lesson teaches a new concept and then asks students to complete a simple exercise that
demonstrates that they have learned the desired skill.  For example, Lesson 1 calls for students
to go to a repo and find a file.  The secret from the file is emailed to the instructor as
proof that the student did the work.

Any teacher can use these lessons to teach the required skills without investing any effort. 
This is an open source project to allow anyone interested in developing the lessons to do so.
There will likely be many more users than contributors.  But contributors are welcome.


## Universal Skill

Every class where file management is important should be using version control at some
level. This project makes it easy for teachers to incorporate version control ideas into
their class without having to do any work to teach the material.

Students that have learned the key skills in one class will already know what the trick
is to each lesson and will be able to complete it rapidly.  Version control is a foundational
skill that every student should know. This project make it easy to teach.
